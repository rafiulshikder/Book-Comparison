## Note to Professor

Dear Professor,

I would like to bring to your attention that I was unable to implement multithreading in this project due to technical limitations on my personal computer. Despite multiple attempts, the multithreaded implementation was causing unexpected behavior and system instability due to unknown hardware/software compatibility issues. Therefore, I proceeded with a single-threaded implementation to ensure reliable and correct functionality of the program.

I understand that multithreading was a desired component, but I focused on delivering a robust solution that meets all other requirements. The current implementation still achieves the core objectives of text analysis and book comparison effectively.

Thank you for your understanding.🙏🙏🙏
