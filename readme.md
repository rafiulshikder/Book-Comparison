# 📚 Book Comparison Project

## 🎯 Overview

An elegant text analysis project that explores the fascinating relationships between 64 literary works. Using sophisticated comparison algorithms, this project uncovers hidden patterns and similarities in classic literature.

## ✨ Key Features

- Identifies the 100 most influential words across the literary corpus
- Generates a comprehensive 64x64 similarity matrix
- Reveals the top 10 most closely related book pairs
- Processes and analyzes raw text with precision
- Implements robust comparison algorithms

## 📊 Results Highlight

Our analysis revealed some fascinating connections between books. Here are some notable findings:

1. Gerard's Herbal volumes show remarkable similarity (91% match between Vol. 3 and Vol. 4)
2. Memoirs of Laetitia Pilkington demonstrates strong narrative consistency across volumes
3. Foxes Book of Martyrs maintains thematic coherence throughout different parts

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- Custom `Book` class for efficient text representation
- Advanced text preprocessing pipeline
- Sophisticated similarity calculation algorithms
- Comprehensive word frequency analysis

### Technology Stack
- Language: C++
- Data Format: Raw text files
- Analysis Method: Statistical text comparison

## 📈 Performance

The program efficiently processes 64 books and performs:
- Word frequency analysis across entire corpus
- 2,016 unique book-to-book comparisons
- Similarity ranking and sorting

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure all book text files are in the designated directory
3. Compile the C++ source files
4. Run the executable
5. Find results in the output directory

## 📝 Output Files

The program generates several output files:
- `common_words.txt`: Top 100 most frequent words
- `similarity_matrix.txt`: Complete comparison matrix
- `similar_books.txt`: Top 10 most similar book pairs

## 🔍 Future Scope

- Natural Language Processing integration
- Interactive visualization dashboard
- Semantic analysis capabilities
- Genre classification features
- Multi-language support

## 💡 Technical Note

The current implementation uses a single-threaded approach to ensure maximum stability and reliability. While this design choice impacts processing speed, it guarantees consistent results across all system configurations.
